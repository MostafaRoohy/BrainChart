# BrainyCharts
*Python Wrapper For Tradingview's Advanced Charts*

**Seamlessly integrate TradingView's world-class Advanced Charts into your Python workflows.**  
*A bridge between pythonic algo-trading and the most beautiful financial visualizations.*

## üåü Why This Project?

TradingView's charts are the gold standard in financial visualization, but using them programmatically in Python has been nearly impossible ‚Äì until now. This library lets you:

‚úÖ **Render TradingView's** directly in Jupyter notebooks or web apps *(Under Developement)*  
‚úÖ **Sync Python data** (Pandas, NumPy) with TradingView's interactive widgets *(Under Developement)*
